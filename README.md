# Artisan Maker Website

For my father-in-law.



```bash
npm install
```

## Build the static site

To build and launch the site using [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/):

```bash
npm start
```

(Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.)

To build the site for production and compress HTML files:

```bash
npm run production
```

The site is built in the `/build` folder.
