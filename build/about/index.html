  				<h1>About me</h1>

  			<p>When I was younger I used to thatch roofs ad when I came off a roof, once
completed, I was full of all the difficulties the roof had presented. Perhaps a
curve was not exactly as I had envisaged or I had to compromise the eave line
due to a structural obstacle. I hated the roof and was completely embroiled in
the difficulties.</p>
<p>And then, perhaps six months later, I would unintentionally drive past and think
<em>oh my god</em> that is beautiful, I cannot believe I did that. It was such an
overwhelming feeling.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the same with my jewellery and pots. After I have completed a piece I need
to be away from it for a while in order to be able to even begin to relate to
it sensibly.</p>
<p>Each of my jewellery pieces is designed and hand crafted by me. Each is unique
and I take care to describe each in detail, as none are the same.</p>
